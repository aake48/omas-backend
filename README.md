# How to start with dev
## 1st Setup PostgreSQL database

### 1st method: postgres docker container (recommended method)
With docker installed, use ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up```
### 2nd method: local install
Install  and setup the lastest version of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).  
Go with the defaults when installing postgres. No additional dependencies or software are needed. 
Next create a postgres database either in SQL shell (psql) or pgadmin.

To create a database in SQL shell, use the following: 
```
create database omas; 
```
To check that omas db was created, type: \l

## 2nd create env.properties 
Create env.properties file in the root of the project.

env.properties should contain the following:
```
OMAS_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/omas
OMAS_DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
OMAS_DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
OMAS_SECRET_KEY=48794134879942idontlikedogs1323572342328789
OMAS_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
OMAS_SMTP_USERNAME=
OMAS_SMTP_PASSWORD=
OMAS_SMTP_PORT=587 
OMAS_RECOVERY_PAGE_URL=https://localhost:3000/recovery
OMAS_TOKEN_VALIDITY_DURATION=28800000
OMAS_MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=10
OMAS_BAN_DURATION=86400000

#either prod, dev or 'dev,TestDataForFrontend' //if TestDataForFrontend is present, TestDataForFrontend.java will be run. This should be removed when running backend's tests.
OMAS_PROFILES=dev,TestDataForFrontend
```
## 3rd create keystore and certificate
Create a keystore folder in resources folder

Create a key in terminal with the following command:

keytool -genkeypair -alias omas -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore omas.p12 -validity 365 -ext san=dns:localhost

Create a certificate keytool -export -keystore omas.p12 -alias omas -file omas-cert.crt

If you are using Windows, open the certificate:
![Certificate install](./docs/certificate_install1.png)

Press install certificate
This window should popup:

![Certificate install2](./docs/certificate_install2.png)

Press next
Select "Place all certificate in the following store"

![Certificate install3](./docs/certificate_install3.png)

Select Trusted Root Certification Authorities

![Certificate install4](./docs/certificate_install4.png)

Select next and finish.

## 4th run 
Run main found in <ins>src/main/java/com/omas/webapp/WebappApplication.java</ins>
